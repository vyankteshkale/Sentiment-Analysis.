Subtheme sentiment analysis task : 

Take the following example:

“One tyre went missing, so there was a delay to get the two tyres fitted. The way garage dealt
with it was fantastic.”

In this review there are numerous insights, insights we call “subtheme sentiments”. A Subtheme
sentiment is generally a sentiment towards an aspect or a problem.

If we look at the subtheme sentiments of the above review we will get a clearer sense what these
generally are.
incorrect tyres sent negative garage service positive wait time negative
The main difference between these subthemes is that Garage Service and Wait Time are aspects
of the service that can be positive or negative while
Incorrect Tyres Sent denotes a problem, something inherently negative.
